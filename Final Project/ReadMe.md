For this final project, my partner and I had to do a final project to prove that we had learned the materials taught in this course. To demonstrate the concepts covered in the course, we made a slot machine game. For this project, we had to make our FPGA board display graphics onto a VGA monitor. We had to show that we could create moving sprites/objects and that we were capable of displaying text on the monitor. We also have to connect either a keyboard or mouse to the board using the PS2 communication protocol. Lastly, the professor made it clear that we also had to include either the use of the SPI communication protocol, I2C protocol, XADC chip, or some Audio I/O cores. For our group project, we decided to display our slot machine with the VGA monitor. We utilized the ghost sprites we learned to make in class to represent our slots. We have also learned how to animate these sprites by using sprite sheets. We could change the color of the ghosts and make them seem like they are moving in place. To satisfy the PS2 communication protocol requirement, we decided to use a mouse to help us control our slot machine. We have also decided it would be interesting to use the I2C communication protocol to interact with the time of flight peripheral module we used in the class once before. These last two devices will help us control what actions we want to take in this game. When we start up the game program. The VGA monitor will display on-screen text saying "Gambling Time" and then the three ghosts will appear, changing colors and moving in place for the first few seconds. After this, we can tell the program how much we want to bet on the machine. The seven-segment displays on the right side of the board how much money we want to spend. We use the Pmod to set this amount by placing our hand over the Pmod and creating the distance with our hand which will give us the amount we want on the right seven-segment displays. There are no imposed limits on how much money you can bet. We would then have to confirm the option and activate the slot machine with a click of the left mouse button. Once we confirm our choice, the money we betted will be added to our jackpot amount, which is displayed on the left seven-segment displays, the ghosts will change colors and animate for a bit, then show us a final color the ghosts will take for this round. You only win the jackpot if all the ghosts change into the same color. Once you win the jackpot, the amount on the left seven-segment display will reduce to zero, and the three ghosts will move in place. The program doesn't end once you win, so one can continue to bet on the machine. Anytime during the game, the player can click the right mouse button to clear the current jackpot amount. The idea is that the owner of slot machines would like to clear out the jackpot after a while, so we made this an option on our mouse.
