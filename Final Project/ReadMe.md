For this final project, my partner and me had to do a final project to prove that we had learned the materials taught in this course. To the concepts covered in the course, we have made a slot machine game. For this project, we had to make our FPGA board display graphics onto a VGA monitor. We had to show that we can create moving sprites/object and that we are capable of displaying text on the monitor. We also have to connect either a keyboard or mouse to the board using the PS2 communication protocol. Lastly, the professor made it clear that we also had to include either the use of the SPI communication protocol, I2C protocal, XADC chip, or some Audio I/O cores. For our group project, we had decided that We were going to display our slot machine with the VGA monitor. We used ghost sprites we learned to make in class as our slots. We have also learned how to animate these sprites with the use of a sprite sheet. We could change the color of the ghosts and make them seem like they are moving in place. To satisfy the PS2 communication protocol requirement, 



what we did




WHat does the program do?
display gambing time on the screen and the ghosts then explaint rythm of the game. ........ (for sake of time, we didn't implement a random method in this so after 23 shots you win)




used systemverilog HDL, microcontrollers concepts, C++, and video buffer stuff
