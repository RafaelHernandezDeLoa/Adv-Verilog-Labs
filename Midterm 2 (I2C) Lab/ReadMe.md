Before the midterm, the professor told us to buy a time of flight peripheral module and learn how to use it with our FPGA board. He told us this so that by the day of the midterm, he would be able to have us create a C++ program using the Pmod without having the students spend time on the midterm day to find out how the Pmod works or take the time to made the HDL code and drivers to access the Pmod. This Pmod is a module that measures the distance between it and an object within its view. So before the midterm, I read up on all the documentation on the Digilent website where I bought the Pmod, understood what each pin of the Pmod is for, and how to measure distance with it. I updated my HDL code so my board could communicate with the module property in the I2C communication protocol. I updated my C++ code to include functions that would initiate the I2C protocol, set up the Pmod to be ready to be called onto to measure distance, and take a measurement of the distance between it and the object in front of it. After this, I just had to wait till the day of the midterm so that the professor could tell me what kind of program he wanted us to make involving these measurements I made with my Pmod. The professor wanted us to display our distance on our seven-segment displays and display color on one of the RGB LEDs on the FPGA board. The color of the RGB LED will depend on how enormous the measured distance is and based on the color spectrum shown below.
