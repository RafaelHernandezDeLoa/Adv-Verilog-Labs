Before the midterm, the professor told us to buy a time of flight peripheral module and learn how to use it with our FPGA board. This was so that on the day of the midterm, he could be able to tell us to create the necessary C++ code to achieve a certain task with the Pmod without having the students spend that time finding out how the Pmod works or to take the time to create the HDL code and drivers to even access the Pmod. This Pmod is a module that measures distance between it and an object within its view. So before the midterm I read up on all the documentations on it in the Digilent website where I bought the Pmod, understood what each pin of the Pmod means, and how to measure distance with it. I updated my HDL code so that my board will to communicate with the module property in I2C communication protocal. I updated my C++ code to include functions which would initiate the I2C protocal, set up the Pmod to be ready to be called onto measure distance, and (actually take the distance)............
