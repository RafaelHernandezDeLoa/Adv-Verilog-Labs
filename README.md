# Adv-Verilog-Labs

I should disclaim how we are using someone elses mmio controller system..... and how some of the labes after 8 might lack the rest of the system.

mention that some labs have the defualt functions still in it and the functions I have created are usally in the later/end part of the program.

note: in the repo description (not here exactly, find it under settings???), mention the things one will find here. The use of spi, i2c,... ect.

explain how multiplexers is a group or don't mention it...

mention I have used the nexas
