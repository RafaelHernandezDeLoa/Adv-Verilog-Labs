# Adv-Verilog-Labs

Consists of some projects I had to complete in this course which requires knowledge of Verilog, SystemVerilog, C++, drivers, microcontroller concepts as well as experience using Vitis and Vivado

The SPI, PS2, Midterm 2 and Final project was created with the microcontroller system that Pong P. Chu used in his book "PGA Prototyping by SystemVerilog Examples: Xilinx MicroBlaze
MCS SoC Edition"

This microcontroller system is not shown in the SPI and PS2 labs sinces I only needed to change the main file but can be visable in the Midterm 2 and Final project.

I have used the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board to complete these projects.

Note: "the multiplexers" is just a group name me and my partner came up with. Most of these labs was done individual so these labs are just my version of the lab that I have done.
